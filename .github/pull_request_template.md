**Additionally, format your pull requests like this:**
- *Of course a fitting title*
  - Make sure the title states what you updated in your PR
- *Update your PR or send a comment with updated content whenever you change something to your PR*
  - This will make it easier to review whenever you have updated something
- *Use this as an example if you do not know where to start*
  - ```md
    ## Insert title that you used for the PR

    # If it fixed an issue based on any issue from the issues tab:
    - This PR fixes multiple issues:
      - What the issue is about, + based on issue #issueNumber (e.g. Night theme since the latest Somtoday Update, based on issue #41 )

    # If an update, and was not an issue:
    - This PR modified:
      - What you modified (e.g. Night theme svg, to make it look more modern)

    # If you added something new:
    - This PR introduced:
      - What you added (e.g. Added sounds whenever you get a notification)

    # If you add any edits to your PR after you have filed it, add this before you add more content:
    # EDITS:
    
    # After this, add any attachment if needed
    ```
  - You don't have to fill in everything, only whatever applies.
  - Make sure your pull request targets the correct base branch, and that both bases match.
